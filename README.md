# Foils analysis

- experimenting with XFoil via python
- checking NeuralFoil a neural approximation of XFoil based on training a MLP on millions of XFoil input/output
- exploring eulerian particle grid-based simulation - EFoil
- compare those results against XFoil
- discover simulation formulation to make those closer
- for this purpose implement simulation with pytorch and optimize
- if successful apply EFoil on non standard foils , in particular foil describing wing foil
